# React + Vite

This project is a grade point calculator, built with react and tailwind. Its responsive on any screen width, and accurate for any calculation provided the that the method of calculation is the same as the one built in this calculator(which is the method used by my school).

I also implemented a localstorage functionality to help student preserve data without loosing them on every render.
